## **TECHNICAL BACKGROUND**

#### Full Stack Development
- I have over 6.6 years of experience as a Full Stack Developer, specializing in building scalable web and mobile applications, as well as internal tools to improve operational efficiency.

#### Web Development
- I have extensive experience in web development using technologies such as MongoDB, Express.js, Angular/React, and Node.js.
- I have created end-to-end web applications and developed web service components for RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js.
- Proficient in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js for micro-service development and ensuring their security against internal and external threats.

#### Serverless Applications
- I excel in building serverless applications using Node.js as the primary programming language. I leverage the asynchronous and event-driven nature of Node.js to create highly scalable and high-performance solutions.

#### Microservices
- I am an expert in building optimized microservices and libraries that can be used in both Node and TypeScript environments.

#### Front-End Development
- I have extensive experience in building web user interfaces (UI) using Angular/React.js. I am well-versed in working with NGRX framework and Redux architecture, using complex Object-Oriented concepts to enhance website performance.

#### Data Science
- I have a strong background in data science, including using R programming for statistical analyses and data manipulation.
- I have explored machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn and TensorFlow in Python, as well as various packages in R for predictive modeling and statistical inference.
- Proficient in data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python, and ggplot2 in R to create compelling visual representations of complex data sets.

#### Cloud Computing (AWS)
- I have experience in designing and implementing robust microservices-based architectures using multiple AWS services such as Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and API Gateway. These architectures resulted in highly available and resilient systems that processed over 1 million transactions per day with 99.99% uptime, particularly in the telecommunication and banking domains.

#### DevOps and Tools
- Proficient in Continuous Delivery build pipeline tools like Git, Docker containerization, and container orchestration technologies like Kubernetes.

#### Languages and Technologies
- Programming Languages: Java, JavaScript, Typescript, Python, R
- Operating System: Linux, Windows, Mac OS
- Database: MongoDB, DynamoDB, RedisDB
- Data Science: Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow), R (data manipulation, statistical analyses, ggplot2)
- Frameworks and Tools: AngularJS, Angular 2/4/6/7/8/9/11/13, Node.JS, React.JS, Redux, NGRX, Jest, Mocha for Unit Testing, SonarQube, PUML, Swagger, Postman automation
- Others: Grafana, Splunk, Elasticsearch, Bitbucket, Gitlab, JIRA, Rally
